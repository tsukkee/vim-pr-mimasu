INTRODUCTION					*mimasu* *vim-pr-mimasu*

vim-pr-mimasu is a Vim plugin for reviewing GitHub Pull Requests.
It shows changed files in a tree view and opens a 3-pane diff layout where
the current file is opened as a real file, allowing LSP features to work.

Requirements:
- Vim 8.0+ with |job| and |channel| support
- gh CLI (https://cli.github.com/) installed and authenticated
- Git repository with an open pull request

==============================================================================

						*:Mimasu*
:Mimasu		Open the PR review tree sidebar. If already open, close it
		(toggle behavior). Fetches PR information asynchronously
		using gh CLI.

						*:MimasuClose*
:MimasuClose	Close the PR review tree and any open diff windows.

==============================================================================

KEY MAPPINGS					*mimasu-mappings*

The following mappings are available in the tree buffer:

<CR>		Open the selected file in diff view, or toggle a directory.
o		Same as <CR>.
<2-LeftMouse>	Same as <CR>.
q		Close the PR review tree and diff windows.

==============================================================================
LAYOUT						*mimasu-layout*

When a file is selected, the following 3-pane layout is created:
>
  ┌──────────┬──────────────┬──────────────┐
  │  Tree    │  Base file   │ Current file │
  │  (left)  │  (diff left) │ (diff right) │
  │  40col   │  :diffthis   │ :diffthis    │
  └──────────┴──────────────┴──────────────┘
<
The current file (right) is opened as a real file, so LSP features
such as go-to-definition, completion, and diagnostics remain active.

The base file (left) is a read-only scratch buffer showing the file
content from the PR's base branch.

==============================================================================
